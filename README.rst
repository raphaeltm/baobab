Baobab
######

Baobab is a system built to reuse templates and inject variables in html documents to generate static
websites that can be easily deployed to a static hosting service like Amazon's S3.

It was built specifically with web designers in mind, who may want to put together a few static pages and have the
content change, but the layout stay the same, without having to setup a full-blown CMS and having the flexibility to
easily modify pages.
